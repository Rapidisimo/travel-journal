# Scrimba Solo Project (React) - Travel Journal

### [Live Version](https://rapidisimo.github.io/travel-journal/)
[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/Rapidisimo/travel-journal)

## My Objectives
Feel comfortable with using React props, designing a project with re-usability in mind and modify the design a bit.

## Requirements
1. ✅ Data array in separate .js file   
  1.1 ✅ Title, location, Google Maps link, start date, end date, description, image URL
2. ✅ Use .map() and props to create each entry in the travel journal
3. ✅ ⭐️Styled & Polished⭐️

## Additional Work Beyond Requirements
1. Slightly modify the design.
2. Change the design based on viewport size.

### Question/Challenges
- I felt the CSS to be the most challenging for this project.

### Update
- Updated App.jsx to use spread operator and updated props naming in components.
- Updated header component to update link structure and added aria labels.
- Use em instead of rem for margins and padding.
- Make less use of <section> when a div is more appropiate. Updated Location.jsx to reflect this.
- Fix issue with margins when vertically resizing page. Cause: dvh css value - Solution: Add a minimum-height value.
